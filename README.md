# Electron 3d engine

This is a 3d engine created with electron following the [console 3d engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih20l3pJoeU) tutorial series by: [javidx9](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder)

I have expanded it to some extent from the tutorial series, and in general I am using this project as an exercise for 3d graphics and math.
